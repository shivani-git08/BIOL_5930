Cell Growth Analysis

Project Goals:- 
This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for analyzing Incucyte imaging data tracking cell confluence over time for multiple cell lines under different condititons. The primary objectives are:-

- Preprocess and clean Incucyte-generated time-series data.
- Analyze growth rates, doubling times, and time to 50% confluence for each cell lines.
- Compare growth dynamics under specific conditions to identify patterns.
- Cluster cell lines based on growth behavior using statistical and machine learning methods.
